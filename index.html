      Now is th ewinter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of 
      york; And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of 
      the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; Our bruised
      bruised arms hung up for mounments; Our stern alarums changed to mercy
      meetings, Our dreadful to delightful measures. Grim-visual. smooth'd his 
      wrinkled front;

      A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' 
      block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project 
      that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph 
      from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing 
      the writers' block in the first place.
